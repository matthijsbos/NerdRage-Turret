# NerdRage
Nerf turret project that features two eletronically controlled axes of rotation. Primarily built out of wood, common hardware and  electronics such as Raspberry Pi 3, ESP32, stepper motors and lithium battery cells. A [Nerf Speedswarm](https://nerf.fandom.com/wiki/Speedswarm) was used for the firing mechanism. Future upgrades will include image recognition using the Raspberry Pi camera.
